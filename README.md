## Contributing Guidelines
* All changes are made on the `master` branch directly, ensure local copy is up to date before making changes. Push all stable changes. ***Do not*** create new branches as git cannot handle merge conflicts in KiCAD source files
* All plaintext files should have `lf` EOL only. Windows users ensure `$ git config --global core.autocrlf true`
* Commit messages should be concise and in present tense imperative. Capitalize first letter and whenever necessary (eg. for acronyms), no period at the end
